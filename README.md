# AirGapped Evenths

AirGapped Evenths is very intuitive dApp that allows users either to  be checked if they are allowed to enter to a eventh or also in a very easy way to organize evenths. The dApp has a home and after login it allows users to get to any information logged in as "Attendee" or "Organizer":

## As an Attendee

It will just cost you one click to login in the Attendee's page and you will be able to see your NFTS on the left table and on the right table you will be able to see which evenths you can attend according to the NFTs that you own. Please see below the image that the address on both tables in some cases matches and thats why, the user would be allowed to attend the event, so the right table brings to this page the events in the smart contract of the events that only matches with their own NFTS.

## As an Organizer

AS mentioned before the same wallet could want to attend or create an event as well, no complications to have privileges to do so, I wanted to make it really easy to use.

Anyways,
